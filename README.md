Coding Platform: Google Colab
## Processes
### Step 1 Data Process and Preparation for Data Training
It comproises of the following but not limited to: data type identification in dataset, undesried data drops, encoding categorical variables utilization.
### Step 2 Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Use TensorFlow to design neural networks or deep learning model to classify and create a binary classification model for prediction.
### Step 3 Model Optimization
Use TensorFlow, optimize your model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
### Step 4 Final Report on the Neural Network Model
